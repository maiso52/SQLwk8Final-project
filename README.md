ðŸ“¦ E-commerce Store Database (MySQL)
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a full-featured relational database for an online e-commerce store (similar to an online jersey shop).
The database is designed to manage users, products, categories, orders, payments, and shipping addresses with proper constraints and relationships.

ðŸ›  Features

âœ… Users can register and place orders.

âœ… Products are organized into categories.

âœ… Orders can contain multiple products (many-to-many).

âœ… Payments are linked one-to-one with orders.

âœ… Addresses store customer shipping and billing details.

âœ… Proper constraints:

PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE

Cascade updates/deletes where appropriate.

SELECT name, price, stock FROM Products WHERE stock > 0;

-- Find orders by a specific user
SELECT order_id, status, order_date
FROM Orders
WHERE user_id = 1;

-- Get order details with products
SELECT o.order_id, p.name, oi.quantity, oi.price
FROM Order_Items oi
JOIN Orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
JOIN Products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_id = 1;

âœ… Next Steps

Add sample data (INSERT statements) for testing.

Create views for reports (e.g., monthly sales).

Add stored procedures for business logic (e.g., auto-update stock).
